# Code Refactor

The existing code was refactored with minor fixes (e.g. broken link fixed) and improvements to make it more readable.
Semantic HTML elements were added to improve the logical structure of the code. This will also enhance the interaction of the site with search engines.

Comments were added and indentation checked/corrected where necessary to make future editing,troubleshooting and improvement more streamlined. 
Image files did not previously contain an alt attribute to denote the type of content incase the link had failed or become unavailable.

Heading attributes were checked for proper sequence and an appropriate title was added to the page.
